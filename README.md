- For Visual Studio Code [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) and [Dart](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code).

### Running the app on emulator
Import the project folder into your environment, you may need to enable plugin access when prompted. Otherwise, manually enable at least Dart and Flutter plugins.

Run the emulator on your device and configure your environment to detect it.
- [How to configure in Android Studios](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
